 ## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](./public/text_mode_screen.png)

There are many great resume generators out there, however, I didn't find one that really boils down the simplicity and the reason for that is because I believe your time should be focused on the resume content and on the design of it, but both of these should be addressed seperately.

Of course, no one template will serve everyone since your resume content and sections may be vastly different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
